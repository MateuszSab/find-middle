# find-middle

I have used init and last instead of head and tail to skew search towards left side.

Changed counter to remove last element when it is odd.

Used reverse before headOption to get right (left :) ) element. 

I have looked on lists that are produced by the original application. Found out it is returning right half of a list.

I have decided to revere this process to get lef side of a list.
